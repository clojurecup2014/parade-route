; Test of gen-class facility.
;
; Place this file in the clojure subdirectory of your main directory.
; Compile the file C.cs via:  csc /t:library C.cs
; Place C.dll in your root directory.
; Start Clojure and do:
;   (System.Reflection.Assembly/LoadFrom "C.dll")
;   (compile 'clojure.testgenclass)
;
; You should then be able to play games such as:
;
;  (def v (test.my.gen/fy 12 "test" "thingy"))
;  (.m2 v 12)
;  (.State v)
;  (.getx v)
;  (.setx v 99)
;  (.getx v)
;
;  Also, you should be able to go to your root directory and execute test.my.gen.exe.
;  It will load everything and call the main routine listed below.
